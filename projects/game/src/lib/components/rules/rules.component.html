    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>VIKTORY&nbsp;II is a combined arms war game for 2 to 8 players, fought on a hex tile map. Armies fight more strongly when comprised of units of different types rather than piles of the same unit. Certain terrains and urban developments strengthen the defender, and units converging from multiple directions strengthen the attacker.</p>
    <a name="Overview.Unit%20support">
      <p>A player's available military units are determined by the towns and cities they control, and the type of terrain those cities are in:</p>

      <p>The military units do not have to remain in the town or city hexes, they are free to move anywhere on the board. Capturing a town or city increases the attacker's units by the numbers above, and reduces the defender's units by the same numbers.</p>
      
      <p>A player moves and battles with the military units they have on the board at the beginning of their turn. Units lost in battle are moved to their owner's reserve. A player can place units in their reserve on to the board at the end of their turn. Also at the end of their turn, a player can build new towns or upgrade an existing town into a city, increasing their available military units.</p>

  </a>

    
  <a name="Setup">
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>The game begins with an empty board surrounded by water. On each player's initial turn, they reveal five starting hexes. Place them in any order by dragging them to the board. The player then places their capital&nbsp;(<span class="piece-image" [template-projection]="pieceLibrary" [key]="{type:'Capitol'}" [context]="teamCtx"></span>)&nbsp;on any of the land hexes by clicking it with the left mouse. A town will be placed there as well, along with an infantry. The player may immediately build another town on a land hex that is exactly two or three spaces away from the capital hex, and once built, place another infantry in the second town or in the capital. As the towns are built, they reveal the hexes immediately surrounding them, and the player places those in any order. The first turn then ends.</p>
    <p>In 2-6 player games, the first player may not place a second town on their first turn.</p>
    <!--
    <p>Recommendations: The capital hex preference order: forest, grassland, plains then mountain. Place to one side of center. Place a second land hex (grassland if you have one, else something different from capital hex) two spaces away from capital. Place second infantry in second town.</p>
    -->
  </a>
    
  <a name="Movement">
    <h2>Movement</h2>
    <p>Beginning on their second turn, players may move their military units in accordance to their range and restrictions. Move units by pressing and holding the left mouse button to grab the unit, and releasing the unit into a target hex (outlined in orange).</p>

    <a name="Movement.Difficult%20terrain">
      <p><b>Difficult terrain</b> is a forest or mountain hex that contained no units at the beginning of a player's turn. If the player has a town or city in the hex, it is not difficult. If the player started their turn with any type of land unit in the hex (even if all the units have already left it) the hex is not difficult for them this turn, and will be marked with a pennant&nbsp;(<span class="piece-image" [template-projection]="pieceLibrary" [key]="{type:'Pennant'}" [context]="teamCtx"></span>). A hex that is difficult terrain at the start of a turn will remain difficult for the remainder of the turn, regardless of previous turns or other units moved in that turn.</p>
    </a>
    
    <a name="Movement.Ports">
      <p>A <b>port</b> is a land hex with a town or city, and with water hexes on at least two sides. If a player controls the port town or city, they may move their frigates from one water hex, through the port hex, to the other water hex. That movement will count as two hexes, just as if the port were water. A frigate may never stop in a port hex.</p>
    </a>
    
    <a name="Movement.Exploration">
      <p>As a unit is moved, any unexplored hexes adjacent to the unit are revealed. The unit must pause while the player places the revealed hexes in any order. The unit can then resume moving according to its remaining allowance and restrictions.</p>
      <p>Units may only be moved one at a time. The unit previously moved forfeits any remaining movement once another unit is moved.</p>

    <a name="Movement.Roads%2fFerries">
      <p>A land unit in their own town or city hex may move to another of their own town or city hexes two or three hexes away from the first at a cost of only one movement. Difficult terrain does not hinder movement along these notional roads/ferries for any unit, however they can be blocked by enemy units. There must be at least one route two or three hexes in length free of enemy units between the towns/cities. The notional roads/ferries do not help units in the non-urban hexes between the towns and cities.</p>
    </a>

    <p>A unit that enters a hex containing an enemy unit, town or city must immediately stop, forfeiting any remaining movement.</p>

  <a name="Transporting">
    <h2>Transporting</h2>
    <p>Land units may be transported by frigates in lieu of movement. Load land units by pressing and holding the left mouse button to grab the land unit, releasing it on an available adjacent frigate. Unload land units by pressing and holding the left mouse button to grab the land unit and release the land unit in an adjacent land hex.</p>

    <a name="Transporting.3%20units%20max">
      <p>Frigates may only transport three land units per turn. Land units that have moved cannot be loaded. Land units that have been unloaded cannot be moved.</p>

    <a name="Transporting.Unloading">
      <p>Unloading land units immediately ends a frigate's movement. Frigates may only unload land units into a single adjacent hex.</p>
      <p>Loaded land units do not contribute to a frigate's attack or defense, they are cargo only, and are returned to the reserve if the frigate is lost in battle.</p>

  <a name="Bombardment">
    <h2>Bombardment</h2>
    <p>Artillery and frigates may bombard enemy military units in adjacent hexes. Bombard by pressing and holding the right mouse button (or holding a CTRL key with the left button), and releasing in the adjacent hex.</p>
    <p>A single unit may only bombard once per turn. Bombarding immediately ends that unit's movement. Frigates may still unload into any adjacent land hex after bombarding.</p>
    <p>One attacker die is rolled per bombardment, and <a href="#Battles.Scoring%20hits">hits are scored as below</a>.</p>

  <a name="Battles">
    <h2>Battles</h2>
    <p>A unit that ends its movement in a hex with an enemy military unit, town or city initiates a battle that must be resolved before the movement/battle phase of the turn ends. These hexes will flash. More units may be brought in to the hex before the battle is begun. To resolve a battle, click on the hex and press the "Roll for Battle" button.</p>
    <p>Once a battle starts, it must be completely resolved before other units can be moved or other battles started.</p>

No builds are allowed and no units may be placed from the reserves after the first reserve naval battle has started.</p>
